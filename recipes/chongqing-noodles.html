    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chongqing noodles (Chongqing Xiao Mian) are a beloved street food from Chongqing, China, featuring chewy noodles
        tossed in a fiery, numbing sauce. The dish is characterized by its bold málà flavor—combining the heat of chili
        oil with the tingling sensation of Sichuan peppercorns, along with aromatic garlic, ginger, and a savory-spicy
        sauce base.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Wheat Noodles</li>

        <li>Add chili oil and Sichuan peppercorn powder to the bowl. Adjust amounts based on your heat preference.</li>
        <li>Pour in 2-3 tablespoons of hot vegetable stock or noodle cooking water to thin the sauce slightly. Stir

        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to package directions until just tender.

        <li>Add the hot noodles directly to the bowl with the sauce. Toss thoroughly to coat every strand.</li>
        <li>Add a bit more cooking water if needed to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
