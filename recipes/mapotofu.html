    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Mapo tofu is a classic Sichuan dish of soft tofu simmered in a spicy, aromatic sauce made with fermented bean paste, chili oil, garlic, and minced meat (usually pork or beef). It's known for its bold málà flavor—spicy heat balanced by the tongue-tingling numbness of Sichuan peppercorns.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Soft Tofu</li>
                <li>Ground Pork</li>
                <li>Doubanjiang</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Chili Oil</li>
                <li>Sichuan Peppercorns</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Chicken Stock</li>
                <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
                <li>Cornstarch</li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Steps </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gently cut tofu into cubes. Optionally warm it in hot (not boiling) water for a minute, then drain—this helps it stay intact.</li>
                <li>Heat neutral oil in a pan over medium heat. Add ground pork (or beef) and cook until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic and ginger. Stir briefly until fragrant, then add doubanjiang and a little chili oil. Cook until the oil turns red and aromatic.</li>
                <li>Pour in chicken stock (or water) and a splash of soy sauce. Bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
                <li>Carefully slide in the tofu cubes. Gently stir or shake the pan so the tofu doesn’t break. Simmer for a few minutes to absorb flavor.</li>
                <li>Mix cornstarch with a little water, then slowly stir it into the pan until the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in Sichuan peppercorns (to taste) and drizzle a bit more chili oil. Give it one last gentle stir.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with rice.</li>
            </ol>
