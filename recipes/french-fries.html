    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French fries are crispy, golden potato strips that are beloved worldwide. The secret to perfect fries is double-frying: a low-temperature fry to cook the interior, followed by a high-temperature fry for that irresistible crispy exterior. Serve them hot with your favorite dipping sauce.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Russet Potatoes</li>
                <li>Vegetable Oil (for frying)</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the potatoes (optional) and cut them into evenly-sized sticks, about ¼ to ½ inch thick.</li>
                <li>Rinse the cut potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch. Soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes (or up to a few hours) for crispier results.</li>
                <li>Drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep pot or fryer to 325°F (160°C). Carefully add potatoes in batches—don't overcrowd the pot.</li>
                <li>Fry for 5-7 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through but still pale. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C). Return the fries to the oil in batches.</li>
                <li>Fry for 2-4 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on fresh paper towels.</li>
                <li>Season immediately with salt while still hot. Serve with ketchup, aioli, or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
            </ol>
